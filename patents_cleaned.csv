The system presents a data connection UI element to represent a data connection between a classic computing domain and a quantum computing domain. The appearance of the change of the data connection UI element indicates a data flow event associated with a data conversion between the classic computing domain and the quantum computing domain.
CN - 25.04.2023,Storage area QoS distribution system based on quantum computing,"The invention discloses a storage area QoS distribution system based on quantum computing, a cloud host, a QKDN and a plurality of quantum computing device network elements are applied, and the cloud host verifies the identities of the quantum computing device network elements; if the verification is passed, allocating system resources to the quantum computing device network element, and allocating a cloud storage area space to the quantum computing device network element in the cloud host; dividing the cloud storage area space into a plurality of independent memory spaces according to service modules of the quantum computing equipment network element, wherein each service module corresponds to one independent memory space; performing traffic limitation on each service module through a double-speed double-bucket token bucket, and setting the same CIR rate and token bucket capacity of a CBS bucket and an EBS bucket for each service module; and the token bucket parameters carry out adaptive dynamic adjustment on each independent service module according to the actual service volume. According to the invention, the QoS strategy is set according to different service types and module conditions, and the service quality of the QKDN is ensured."
